# jig Setup

Bind an installed jig target to a repository GitHub profile, then finish repository convergence. Store only the profile login and host; keep credentials in the GitHub CLI credential store.

## Profile Contract

Resolve the GitHub profile in this order:

1. An explicit profile supplied by the user or `--github-profile`.
2. `JIG_GITHUB_PROFILE` environment variable.
3. `git config --local --get jig.githubProfile`.
4. An authenticated profile whose login matches the current repository owner.

Resolve the host from `JIG_GITHUB_HOST`, then `git config --local --get jig.githubHost`, then `github.com`.

- Treat the environment variable as an ephemeral override; do not replace local config when it is present unless the user asks.
- Otherwise persist the selected login with `git config --local jig.githubProfile <profile>` and the host with `git config --local jig.githubHost <host>`.
- Never put an OAuth token in git config, tracked files, `.env`, logs, or reports.
- Validate the profile with `gh auth token --hostname <host> --user <profile>` without printing the result, then run `gh api user --jq .login` using that token through `GH_TOKEN` (`github.com` or `*.ghe.com`) or `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN` (other hosts).
- Do not use `gh auth switch`; it changes the globally active profile and makes parallel repositories interfere with each other.
- If the requested profile is not authenticated, run `gh auth login --hostname <host>` interactively, then validate the exact profile again.

## Procedure

1. Inspect the repository and installed target:
   - confirm the working directory and git repository
   - inspect `claude plugin list`, `AGENTS.md`, and `GEMINI.md` as available
   - detect the installed target and scope; map jig global scope to Claude Code user scope
2. Resolve and validate the GitHub profile using the Profile Contract. If multiple authenticated profiles remain plausible, ask before selecting one.
3. Configure the profile:
   - keep an existing `JIG_GITHUB_PROFILE` as the session override
   - otherwise write the repository-local `jig.githubProfile` and `jig.githubHost` values
4. Verify the installed target and repair only when incomplete:
   - Claude Code: confirm `jig@jig` is enabled; when missing, run `claude plugin marketplace add 0x0w1/jig --scope <project|user>` and `claude plugin install jig@jig --scope <project|user>`
   - Codex or Antigravity: confirm the jig version stamp and `jig-setup`; when incomplete, rerun `install.sh` for the detected target and preserve the stamped skill selection
5. Verify:
   - Claude Code: `claude plugin list` shows `jig@jig` enabled
   - Codex: `AGENTS.md` has the jig version stamp and `.agents/skills/jig-setup/SKILL.md` exists
   - Antigravity: `GEMINI.md` has the stamp and the same skill file exists
   - the configured profile resolves to the expected login without changing the globally active `gh` account
6. Settle the version rubric:
   - Resolve it from `JIG_VERSION_RUBRIC`, then `git config --local --get jig.versionRubric`, then `.jig/versioning.md`.
   - When the file exists, report its path, source, and whether it records the adopted default or a project-specific rubric. Do not change it.
   - When it is missing, run the `version-rubric` skill. If the user skips the question or does not answer, that skill records the adopted default; do not press for an answer.
   - When the project is clearly not a plain code project, or the user asks which rubric fits, run `rubric-scan` first and pass its recommended type to `version-rubric`.
   - Never reproduce the rubric text here; `version-rubric` owns it.
7. Run `github-sync` for repository convergence, then `jig-doctor` for a read-only health check.

## Safety Rules

- Do not expose or persist tokens outside the GitHub CLI credential store.
- Do not modify shell startup files to persist environment variables.
- Do not overwrite locally modified skills without following installer backup rules.
- Do not create or edit the version rubric directly; delegate to `version-rubric`.
- Do not force push, delete branches, or create a release.
- Preserve unrelated repository and GitHub settings.

## Final Report

Include:

- Target and scope already healthy or repaired
- Profile source: environment | local git config | explicit selection | repository owner
- Profile login and host, never its token
- Files and local config keys changed
- Version rubric: path, source, and kind, or delegated to `version-rubric`
- `github-sync` and `jig-doctor` results
- Skipped or blocked steps and the exact next action
