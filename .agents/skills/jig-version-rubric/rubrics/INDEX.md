# Version Rubric Catalog Index

Ready-made `.jig/versioning.md` drafts, one per project type. `rubric-scan` scans the repository and reads only this file to pick candidate types; `version-rubric` then writes the chosen type's body as the draft. A person can also pick straight from the table.

## Directory

```text
rubrics/
├── INDEX.md         # this file: the type list and the detection signals
├── _template.md     # skeleton for adding a type

└── <type>.md        # one draft per type, all on one level
```

Type drafts live on one level with no grouping directories. The `Consumer` column below does the grouping, because one project often serves several kinds of consumer at once. A directory split pushes such a project into one side, and it moves the file path whenever the project's character changes.

Principles that hold regardless of type are in [Common SemVer Principles](common.md). Grade the ambiguous cases a type draft does not cover from there.

## Which Axis This Catalog Grades On

Every draft here grades on the **SemVer consumer-compatibility axis**. The only question is what existing consumers must change between the previous release and this one.

The rubric `version-rubric` offers by default uses a different axis. That one is the **human-intervention axis**: adding, removing, or replacing capability is all `minor`, and only a change that forces a human to step in becomes `major`. It exists so the number keeps carrying information in a project whose generations turn over quickly.

The two axes grade the same change differently.

| Change | Catalog (SemVer compatibility) | jig default (human intervention) |
|---|---|---|
| A feature or endpoint removed | `major` | `minor` |
| Generation replaced, contract intact | `patch` | `minor` |
| Silent behavior change | `major` | `major` |

**Use one or the other.** Adopting a catalog draft makes that file the project's whole rubric; do not fold questions from the default into it. A project with clear outside consumers — installs, callers, readers — fits the catalog. A project whose only consumer is itself, or whose consumers are not settled yet, fits the default.

## What a Type Actually Changes

The `## Decision Order` in all 17 drafts is effectively the same three questions. A type really changes only four things.

| Section | What differs by type |
|---|---|
| `## Public Interface` | What reaches the consumer. This is the substance of the catalog |
| `## Interface Paths` | Which paths carry that interface, as globs the grading skills match |
| `## Hard Rules` | How this type **breaks quietly, without raising an error** |
| `## Pre-Release Checks` | How to catch that break before releasing |

Write a new type with those four in mind. `## Decision Order` and `## Grade Definitions` only need the three questions from [Common SemVer Principles](common.md) restated with this type's nouns.

The `## Interface Paths` globs in every draft describe the layout the type conventionally uses. They are a starting point, not a fact about the adopting repository: check them against the real tree when adopting, and delete the rows that match nothing.

## How to Choose

1. Write down what **reaches someone else** when this repository releases: an endpoint that is called, a package that is installed, a screen that opens, a document that is read, an asset that is reused, a configuration that is applied.
2. Write down what that person must fix if it breaks. That is this project's public interface, and matching it against the `Consumer` column gives the type.
3. If two or more match, do not pick one — [merge them](#when-several-types-match).

The table is ordered so types with similar consumers sit together: called and executed things at the top, installed and imported things in the middle, read and reused things at the bottom. Whether a developer built the project has no bearing on the grade — a documents-only repository maintained by a developer is still `document-archive`, and a repository maintained by a designer that ships an API is still `api-server`.

## Scan Scoring

1. A strong signal is worth 2 points and a weak signal 1 point. Within one type, the same signal counts once even when it matches several files.
2. A type below 3 points is not reported as a candidate. One incidental file must not promote a type. That also means a single strong signal is not enough on its own — a repository with many documents is not the same as a document repository.
3. Report at most 3 candidates, highest score first, and give **the actual paths that produced the score** for each. Never recommend without evidence paths.
4. If every type scores below 3, pick no type and recommend the default rubric (human-intervention axis) from `version-rubric`.
5. If `monorepo` matches, run the scan once more over the sub-packages and report which types live inside. `monorepo` wraps other types rather than replacing them.

## When Several Types Match

Several consumers mean several types. Do not pick one; do this instead.

- Take the primary type's body as the draft and merge the other types' `## Public Interface` items underneath it.
- When one change grades differently per interface, use **the highest grade**. Shipping a server and a web client together does not let UI compatibility lower the grade while external API consumers exist.
- If artifacts are versioned separately, read [monorepo](monorepo.md) for the propagation strategy.

## Adding a Type

1. Copy [`_template.md`](_template.md) to `<id>.md` on this same level. Do not create a subdirectory.
2. Add a row to the table above, next to the rows with a similar consumer. **A file missing from the table is invisible to the scan.**
3. A strong signal must be a path that appears only in that type. Files that exist everywhere, such as `README.md` or `.gitignore`, are not signals.
4. Fill both required sections (`## Decision Order`, `## Grade Definitions`). The rest are optional.
5. The file must be copyable to `.jig/versioning.md` as-is. Keep catalog commentary and frontmatter out of the body.
